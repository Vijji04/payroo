  - Unit tests for tax calculations
  - Unit tests for superannuation calculations
  - Unit tests for payroll calculations
  - Comprehensive test coverage for critical business logic

- **CI/CD Pipeline**
  - Automated testing on CI pipeline
  - ESLint checks on every commit
  - Build verification before deployment

## Technical Decisions

### Frontend Architecture

- **React Query**: Chosen for its powerful caching, synchronization, and server state management capabilities
- **Zod + React Hook Form**: Provides excellent developer experience with type inference and runtime validation
- **Tailwind CSS**: Enables rapid UI development with utility classes
- **shadcn/ui**: Provides accessible, customizable components without the bloat of a full component library
- **Direct PDF Generation**: Client-side PDF generation for payslips

### Backend Architecture

- **Prisma ORM**: Type-safe database access with excellent TypeScript integration
- **AWS RDS**: Reliable, scalable managed database service

## Tradeoffs & Constraints

### Time-Constrained Decisions

1. **S3 Storage Discarded**

   - **Decision**: Direct PDF download instead of storing in S3
   - **Rationale**: For the scope of this project, direct PDF generation and download provides simpler implementation without the overhead of managing S3 buckets, presigned URLs, and file lifecycle
   - **Future Consideration**: S3 integration would be beneficial for audit trails and historical payslip storage at scale

2. **API Exposure in Frontend**

   - **Decision**: Certain API calls are directly exposed in components rather than abstracted into custom hooks
   - **Rationale**: Prioritized functionality demonstration and rapid development over architectural perfection
   - **Trade-off**: Reduced reusability and slightly harder maintenance
   - **Future Consideration**: Refactor into custom hooks (e.g., `useEmployees`, `usePayrun`) for better separation of concerns and code reuse

3. **Custom Hook Abstraction**
   - **Decision**: Some React Query calls are inline in components
   - **Rationale**: Demonstrates functionality and ease of use in a straightforward manner for the assignment scope
   - **Future Consideration**: Abstract into domain-specific hooks for better testability and reusability

### Security Considerations Addressed

- Input sanitization implemented across all forms
- XSS attack prevention through proper encoding
- SQL injection prevention through Prisma's parameterized queries
- Form validation on both client and server side

### Scalability Considerations

- **Current**: Architecture supports moderate traffic and data volumes
- **Future**: Consider implementing caching layers (Redis), pagination improvements, and microservices separation for high-scale scenarios

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Focus on business logic (tax, super, calculations)
- **CI Integration**: Automated test execution on every push
- **Linting**: Code quality enforced through ESLint
- **Future**: Integration tests and E2E tests for complete user flows

## Hosting

- **Frontend**: While I know the process of implementing it in S3, I choose to implement it in vercel.
- **Backend**: To reduce complexity, render has been used to host the backend instead of AWS lambda or EC2.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a production-ready payroll management system with careful consideration of modern best practices, security, and user experience. The documented tradeoffs reflect pragmatic decisions made to balance feature completeness, code quality, and time constraints while maintaining a solid foundation for future enhancements.
